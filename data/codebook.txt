Where did the data come from?

The data was scrapped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ through two custom R-scripts (schedule_and_results.R and total_basic_box_scores.R).

What is in the data?
The data sets contain information (i.e., schedule and results data and total  basic box scores data) on NBA games from the 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons.

What are the variables in the raw folder?

box_score_urls_2016_2020.csv
boxscore_links = web pages of the box scores

schedule_and_results_2016_2020.csv
Date = date of the game
Start (ET) = start time of the game
Vistor/Neutral = name of the away team
PTS(1) = points scored by the away team 
Home/Neutral = name of the home team
PTS(2) = points scored by the home team
?(1) = box score text
?(2) = overtime
Attend. = attendance
Notes = game remarks

total_basic_box_scores_away.csv and total_basic_box_scores_home.csv
mp = minutes played
fg = field goals
fga = field goal attempts
fg_pct = field goal percentage
fg3 = three-point field goals
fg3a = three-point field goal attempts
fg3_pct = three-point field goal percentage
ft = free throws
fta = free throw attempts
ft_pct = free throw percentage
orb = offensive rebounds
drb = defensive rebounds
trb = total rebounds
ast = assists
stl = steals
blk = blocks
tov = turnovers
pf = personal fouls
pts = points
plus_minus = Box Plus/Minus (BPM)

What are the variables in the processed folder?

box_score_urls_2016_2020.csv

date = date of the game
away_team = name of the away team
points_away = points of the away team
home_team = name of the home team
points_home = points of the home team
attendance = attendance
home_win = Did the home team win? 0 = home team lost; 1 = home team won
point_difference = points home - points away
abs_point_dif = absolute values of point difference (i.e., all point difference values were made positive)
season = season of that particular game
win_percentage = (the number of games won by a home team divided by their total number of games played)*100

total_basic_box_scores.csv
date = date
bubble = Is this a NBA bubble game? Pre-bubble (no); Bubble (yes); Post-bubble (no)
zero = Is this a 2020-21 zero attendance game? Pre-restrictions (no); TRUE (yes); Restricted (no)
attendance = attendance
home_win = Did the home team win? 0 = home team lost; 1 = home team won
point_difference = points home - points away
abs_point_dif = absolute values of point difference (i.e., all point difference values were made positive)

venue = Home or Away
fg = field goals
fga = field goal attempts
fg_pct = field goal percentage
fg3 = three-point field goals

ft_pct = free throw percentage
orb = offensive rebounds
drb = defensive rebounds
trb = total rebounds
ast = assists
stl = steals
blk = blocks
tov = turnovers
pf = personal fouls
points = points
team = team that the data belongs to

total_box_scores_glm_lm.csv contains the same variables and utilizes the same definitions as total_basic_box_scores.csv
HOWEVER THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION
season in total_box_scores_glm_lm.csv consists of 2016-17, 2017-18, 2018-19, 
2019-20 (pre COVID-19 games in the 2019-20 season), 
2019-21 (COVID-19 games that did not have any attendees (includes NBA bubbles games)) 
and 2020-21 (post COVID-19 games that had at least 10% maximum capacity)

Of interest to the current project are: 
abs_point_dif, point_difference, home_win, win_percentage,
venue, season, attendance, fga, fg3a, fta, orb, drb, stl, blk, tov and pf
